<h2>Background and places visited</h2>
<p>My name is <b>Ismael Ouedraogo</b>. I'm a student at Cleveland Codes. I'm a graduate of 
Cleveland States and the University of Ouagadougou. I grew up in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso and went to Cours Marie Curie one of my local high schools. After graduation, I went to the University of Ouagadougou, where I got Bachelor in Environmental Economics and I left Burkina Faso for the United States, I spent my first 2 years in New York, before I moved to Cleveland, where I got my second bachelor's degree in General Economics. I'm from <em>Burkina Faso</em>; a land lock country located in the middle of West Africa. 
<br />Burkina Faso has nineteen million people <a href="http://www.burkina.com/" target= "_blank">Burkina Faso</a>. The country is dry from October to April and rainy from Mai to September. It's sunny all year long. French is the official language, but there are sixty other languages spoken.
</p>
<p>I've visited many countries besides the USA. In fact, I visited Ghana, Nigeria, Benin, and Morocco.
<br />Benin was the first country that I visited, followed by Nigeria, Morocco and the United States. I visited Ghana in December 2018.
<br />The United States is a big country with different varieties of weathers; I visited New York, Florida, and Washington DC.   
</p>
<h2>Hobby, Books read, and Ambitions</h2>
<p>I like visiting places, listening to music, playing soccer: In fact, soccer is the most popular sport in Africa.
For long time, I've spent my life reading non fiction books.<br/>
I want to apply what I'm learning at Cleveland Codes in the real world through Internships and jobs. I also want to continue my education in Software Engineering.Thus, I want to get a master's degree in Software Engineering, and a Project Management Professional certificate before I go home. I also want to be a minister in my country, to bring a little what I'm learning in the United States. Furthermore I want to be among the best African entrepreneurs, a good husband, and a good father.
